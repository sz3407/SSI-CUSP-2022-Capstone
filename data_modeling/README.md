## Data Modeling

The directory contains files relating to the data modeling process of this project. 

### Files

#### "States ARIMA Models.ipynb"
> This notebook describes the processes involved in our prediction modeling. Linear models were used to tune hyperparameters of the ARIMA model. ARIMA was selected as the most appropriate model for this project because the data was over a time series and our aim was to predict future and missing data based on known trends.

### "predictions" directory
> This directory contains files with the output values from the ARIMA model for each state. These values are the predictions for the future benefits outside of the time series for the chosen state living arrangement.
